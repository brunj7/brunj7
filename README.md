### I am helping researchers to make their analytical work more reproducible and collaborative

ðŸ”­ Some projects I am currently working on:

- Developing a new program to help researchers set up their Research lab in a Collaborative and Reproducible (RCL) way: https://ucsb-library-research-data-services.github.io/reproducible-lab/

- [Course on reproducible analytical workflows](https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/) for the Master in Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/)), UC Santa Barbara

-  [Course on databases and data management](https://ucsb-library-research-data-services.github.io/bren-meds213-spring-2024/) for the Master in Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/)), UC Santa Barbara


ðŸ“¦ Some R packages I'm involved with:

- [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/): Co-led with Dr. [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) this project aims at developing an R package with 28 datasets from the [LTER network](https://lternet.edu/) to facilitate the teaching of (environmental) data science. [FEEDBACK](https://github.com/lter/lterdatasampler/issues) wanted :)

- [metajam](https://nceas.github.io/metajam/): easily download and read data **and** metadata from repositories in the DataONE network.
