### I am helping researchers to make their analytical work more reproducible and collaborative

ðŸ”­ Some projects I am currently working on:

- [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/): Co-led with Dr. [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) this project aims at developing an R package with 28 datasets from the [LTER network](https://lternet.edu/) to facilitate the teaching of (environmental) data science. [FEEDBACK](https://github.com/lter/lterdatasampler/issues) wanted :) 
- [Course on reproducible anlaytical workflows](https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/) for the newly launched Master in Environmental Data Science ([MEDS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/)), UC Santa Barbara
